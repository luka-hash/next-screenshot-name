# next-screenshot-name

Part of my smol (Unix-system) tools; this one names the screenshots.

## Installation

```sh
% go install github.com/luka-hash/next-screenshot-name@latest
% # or, more manual approach
% git clone git@github.com:luka-hash/next-screenshot-name
% cd next-screenshot-name
% go build main.go
% mv next-screenshot-name ~/.local/bin/,next-screenshot-name # private tools and scripts start with ',' - for simple completion
```

## TODO

- [ ] Make 'tools' repo, and populate it with all the smol tools
